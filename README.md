# Word Counting

The purpose of this particular repository is to experiment with basic word counting
functionality and a simple combinatoric optimization problem inspired by a toy.

The toy is a set of five consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words made out of wooden
blocks that spin to combine four beginning consonants with four ending consonants (for
each vowel).
